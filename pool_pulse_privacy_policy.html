<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">Last updated: October 16, 2025</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Pool Analyzer</strong> (the “App”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application on iOS and Android. “We”, “us”, and “our” refer to the app publisher, <strong>Valentin Konovalov</strong>.</p>

<div class="box">
  <p><strong>Plain-English summary:</strong> We do <em>not</em> ask you for your name, email, or other direct identifiers. We collect only basic, pseudonymous <em>usage analytics</em> to understand how the App is used and to improve reliability (e.g., screen views, feature usage, diagnostics/crash logs, device model/OS). We do not show ads or engage in cross-context behavioral advertising. The App offers in-app purchases using Apple and Google billing; we do not receive your full payment details.</p>
</div>

<h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>We <em>do not</em> collect the following personal data:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>First and last name</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
  <li>Postal address (Address, State/Province, ZIP/Postal code, City)</li>
  <li>Social media profile information</li>
  <li>Contacts/phonebook, photos/camera, precise GPS location</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage Data &amp; Diagnostics (pseudonymous)</h3>
<p>When you use the App, we collect limited analytics data to maintain and improve functionality, performance, and stability. This may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>App events (e.g., first open, screen views, feature taps), timestamps, and basic interaction metrics</li>
  <li>Device information (e.g., device model, OS version, language, app version)</li>
  <li>Diagnostics and crash logs</li>
  <li>IP address at the time of request (used by our providers for security and coarse geolocation such as country/region)</li>
</ul>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> link this data to your identity, and we do <strong>not</strong> collect precise location, contact lists, photos, or microphone data.</p>

<h3>Payments &amp; Purchases</h3>
<p>The App supports in-app purchases. Payments are processed by the platform stores and their processors. We receive only limited purchase metadata necessary to grant you access (e.g., product identifier, purchase status). We do <strong>not</strong> receive your full card or account numbers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apple App Store In-App Payments (Apple Inc.)</li>
  <li>Google Play In-App Payments (Google LLC)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To operate, maintain, troubleshoot, and improve the App</li>
  <li>To measure basic usage and app performance</li>
  <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues and abuse</li>
  <li>To manage in-app purchases and entitlements</li>
</ul>

<h3>Legal Bases (GDPR, where applicable)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f)) for essential analytics and diagnostics that help us improve the App</li>
  <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> (Art. 6(1)(b)) to provide purchased features and subscriptions</li>
  <li><strong>Legal obligations</strong> (Art. 6(1)(c)) where required (e.g., tax, fraud prevention)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>3) Analytics &amp; Tracking</h2>
<p>We use privacy-respecting analytics providers (e.g., <strong>Google Analytics for Firebase</strong> or similar) to gather pseudonymous usage statistics and diagnostics. We do <strong>not</strong> use advertising identifiers for cross-app tracking, and we do <strong>not</strong> run remarketing campaigns.</p>

<p><strong>Opt-out:</strong> You may disable analytics in the App’s settings (if available) or contact us to request that we minimize analytics to the extent technically possible. Platform settings (e.g., Apple’s App Tracking Transparency) will also be honored where relevant.</p>

<hr>

<h2>4) Ads, Remarketing, and Social Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ads:</strong> We do <em>not</em> show ads in the App.</li>
  <li><strong>Remarketing:</strong> We do <em>not</em> use remarketing services.</li>
  <li><strong>Social:</strong> We do <em>not</em> integrate social logins or a Facebook Fan Page within the App experience.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>5) Payments &amp; Processors</h2>
<p>All purchases are handled by the platform stores:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Apple App Store In-App Payments</strong> — Apple Inc. processes payments under its own terms and privacy notices.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Play In-App Payments</strong> — Google LLC processes payments under its own terms and privacy notices.</li>
</ul>
<p>We receive confirmation that a purchase occurred (e.g., product ID and validity period) to enable features. We do <strong>not</strong> store or process full payment credentials on our servers.</p>

<hr>

<h2>6) Sharing of Information</h2>
<p>We do not sell personal information and we do not “share” it for cross-context behavioral advertising (as defined under the CCPA/CPRA). We may disclose limited data to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Service providers</strong> (e.g., analytics, crash reporting) under contractual confidentiality and data-processing terms</li>
  <li><strong>Platform providers</strong> (Apple, Google) to deliver core app and purchase functionality</li>
  <li><strong>Legal authorities</strong> if required by law or to protect our rights and users’ safety</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>7) Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain analytics and diagnostics data only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this Policy, then aggregate or delete it. Retention periods may vary by provider and platform.</p>

<hr>

<h2>8) Security</h2>
<p>We implement administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<hr>

<h2>9) International Transfers</h2>
<p>We and our service providers may process information in countries other than yours. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) for such transfers.</p>

<hr>

<h2>10) Your Privacy Rights</h2>

<h3>GDPR (EEA/UK/Swiss users)</h3>

<hr>

<h2>12) Do Not Track &amp; Global Privacy Control</h2>
